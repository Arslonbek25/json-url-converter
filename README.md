# JSON URL Converter


This is a simple Python script that converts a JSON file to a URL and vice versa. To use this script, manually create and place your files in the 'decoded' or 'encoded' folders (these folders will be created automatically) and then execute the code blocks in the Jupyter Notebook file or uncomment a function call in main.py and run it.
